# Vana
Hello Guys, Today I made an simple ai assistant called "Vana", Let me show you how:
# Codes:
Create An Welcoming Text

``` python
welcoming = "Vana: Welcome! I'm Vana."
```

Print a Welcoming Text
``` python
print(welcoming)
```

Do a loop so it works
``` python
while True:
```

Create An Input
``` python
vana = input("You: ")
```
Create commands
``` python
if vana == "hello":
   print("Vana: Hello There!")
elif "how are you" in vana:
   print("Vana: I'm Good, You?")
elif "what is your name" in vana:
   print("Vana: I'm Vana, Your Simple AI Assistant Created By Joel!")
elif "author" in vana:
   print("Vana: The author i've been created is: Joel")
elif "goodbye" in vana:
   print("Vana: Have a nice day!")
   break
else:
   print("Vana: Sorry, I cannot understand.")
```
And Boom, You Got Your Own AI Assistant Created By Me.
